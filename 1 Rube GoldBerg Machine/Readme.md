# Grade 11 Video Game Design

## Rube Goldberg Machine

In this section we will be covering the basics of Unity along with making a fun simulation!
Topics covered include : 
* The Unity Launcher and Editor.
* Game Objects, Components, and Hierarchies.
* Physics Materials and Zones.
* Sprites.

Then after going through these we will make a Rube Goldberg Machine. This is a great way to get familiar with many of the main components of Unity.\
If you aren't familiar with Rube Goldberg Machines, here you go!\
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine)
> A Rube Goldberg machine is a machine intentionally designed to perform a simple task in an indirect and overcomplicated fashion. Often, these machines consist of a series of simple devices that are linked together to produce a domino effect, in which each device triggers the next one, and the original goal is achieved only after many steps.

And here are two excellent examples :
* [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w) is one by the band OK Go.
* And [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOMIBdM6N7Q) is one by the YouTuber Joseph's Machines.

### Requirements

To fully complete this project you must meet the following criteria :  
* Go through all the tutorials in this project. 
* A Rube Goldberg Machine that must complete a task (turn on a light, put a ball in a basket, score a goal etc.).
* Backgrounds and sprites must be of a unified theme (Like an ice hockey rink with a puck that collides with hockey sticks and ends in a net).
* Minimum of 15 steps with different physics interactions.
