## Rube Goldberg Machine

To fully complete this project you must meet the following criteria :  
* Rube Goldberg Machine must complete a task (turn on a light, put a ball in a basket, score a goal etc.).
* Backgrounds and sprites must be of a unified theme (Like an ice hockey rink with a puck that collides with hockey sticks and ends in a net). 
* Minimum of 15 steps with different physics interactions.
