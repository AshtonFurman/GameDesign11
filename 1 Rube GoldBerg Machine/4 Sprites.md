# Rube Goldberg Machine

The last section we are going to talk about are Sprites. You might've noticed that we've already been using these in the form of our "WhiteCircle" and "WhiteBox", which is correct. There's a lot more to Sprites than this, more than we could cover now.\ 
For now, we will just go over putting your own sprites into the game using them in a few ways.

## Sprites

You might be wondering why we've called our images "Sprites". Sprite is simply the common name used for a 2D Graphic used in a game.\
 The origin of the name is that Sprite is another word for a ghost. In our game the Sprites float on top of our background like they are ghosts.\
Just an interesting fact for you.

### Importing Sprites

Before we can use a sprite we need to actually put it into our game. We're going to do the same thing we did with the "WhiteBox" and "WhiteCircle" but this time I'm going to let you choose the Sprite.\
