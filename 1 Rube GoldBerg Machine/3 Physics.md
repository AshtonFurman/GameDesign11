# Rube Goldberg Machine

Here we will talk more about the Rigidbody and Physics in Unity.

## Rigidbody

In the last lesson we added a Rigidbody to our circle and saw it fall. Let's talk a bit more about how this Rigidbody works.\
The basic idea behind the Rigidbody is that it gives an object a physical presence in the world. Just like how you have mass and therefore are affected by gravity. If you didn't have mass you wouldn't be affected by gravity.\
There are many other things the Rigidbody, such as apply drag to objects, but we are just using the basis of the component for this project.

## Collisions

Collisions are one of the most important part of making your game work so let's get some going.\
First thing we are going to do is disable the Camera "Gizmo" so we can better see our scene.

### Colliders

In order for our objects to collide we need to give a Collider. This allows an object to collide or hit other collider Objects.\
Colliders are added to an Object the exact same way as Rigidbody. This is because a Collider is yet another Component.\
Click on our first Circle Object and click add component.
