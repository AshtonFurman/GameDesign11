## Dice Game

This unit covers the basics of coding to create a game about rolling dice. It's more interesting than it sounds, don't worry.\
We will be going through the following topics in this unit :
* Basics of coding in C# including :
	* How our code runs and works with Unity.
	* Writing proper and reabable code.
	* Control structures and boolean logic.
	* Variables, scope, and loops.
* Best practices for organizing code in Unity.

The big project for this unit is making a Dice Game. We will create code to generate random numbers. Then we use those numbers to take away health from our players until someone wins. All the while writing a story for us to follow.\
The idea is something like a basic game of Dungeons and Dragons.
