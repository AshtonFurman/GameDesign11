# Dice Game

Here we are going to write our first program.

## Basic Coding

To begin we need to know where to actually write our code.\
In the Editor duh!\
Not exactly we can't just put it anywhere in this file. For this we need to use the `Start()` function.\


```
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class TestScript : MonoBehaviour {

	// Use this for initialization
	void Start () {
	
	}
	
	// Update is called once per frame
	void Update () {
	
	}
}
```
