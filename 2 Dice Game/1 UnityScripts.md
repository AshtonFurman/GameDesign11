Here we are going to figure out what a Script is and how Unity uses them.

## Scripts

Scripts are what we call our code. Our scripts are simply written files that follow specific rules and can be interpreted by our computer.\
Scripts in Unity are treated as other Components like a Rigidbody. You can attach them to any Object and they are written using the Language of C#.

C# is a programming language made by Microsoft and is Object Oriented language.\
We will get more into what this means later.

There is a lot to code. But I think a good way to start is to simply jump into it. Don't worry if not everything makes sense the first time around.

### Adding Scripts In Unity

Start by making a new Unity project. Make the project 2D, though for this project that doesn't really matter.

As stated before, Scripts are just another type of component. Let's start by making a new Folder in our Assets and call it "Scripts".\
Go into that folder and right click, create, and click "New C# Script". Give this script a name like "TestScript".
